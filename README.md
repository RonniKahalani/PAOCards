This memory technique is used in the World Memory Championships, where you quickly browse through a random shuffled deck of cards and recall the cards in chronological order.

This web app is used for training your memory capacity to memorize a full deck of cards, chronologically, using a memory palace, with 17 locations, each holding 3 cards.
If you're "normal", you can master this skill in a few weeks, but you have to be disciplined, persistent and focus on memorizing the PAO Matrix.

## Components
It consists of the following components:
- PAO (Person-Action-Object) Matrix.
- Quiz interface with randomized card decks.
- Memory Palace interface.
