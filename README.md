This memory technique is used in the World Memory Championships, where you quickly browse through a random shuffled deck of cards and recall the cards in chronological order.

This web app is used to train this memory techniaue and expand your capacity to memorize a full deck of cards, chronologically.

## Components
It consists of the following components:
- PAO (Person-Action-Object) Matrix.
- Quiz interface with randomized card decks.
- Memory Palace interface.

## PAO Matrix
<p>If you're "normal", you can master this skill in a few weeks, but you have to be disciplined, persistent and focus on memorizing the PAO Matrix.</p>

## PAO Quiz
<p>The Quiz interface helps you train your PAO Matrix memory speed and correctness, by prompting you to recall the Person, Action & Object values for a given card.</p>
<img width="100%" src="https://learningisliving.dk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/paocards-quiz.png" alt="Quiz">
<p>So the correct answers are</p>

- Person = Victoria Beckham
- Action = Applies makeup in front of
- Object = Mirror
- Card = Queen of Clubs (Q&clubs;)

## PAO Memory Palace
<p>The Memory Palace interface helps you train and navigate your memory palace, which holds 52 cards, in 17 locations, each holding the next 3 cards, with one last card left.</p>
<img width="100%" src="https://learningisliving.dk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/paocards-palace.png" alt="Quiz">
<p>Each location defines a crazy sentence, by combining the person value of the first card, the action value of the second card and the object value of the third card.</p>
<p>So the sentence = "Victoria Beckham - Breaks nail on - Cigarette" represents (Q&clubs;) - (2&hearts;) - (3&diams;)</p>
<p>The second (Flojo), Cigarette (George Clooney) (George Clooney)</p>
