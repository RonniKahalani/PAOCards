This web app is used for training your memory capacity to memorize a full deck of cards, chronologically, using a memory palace, with 17 locations, each holding 3 cards.

This memory technique is used by participants in the World Memory Championships when browsing through a random shuffled card deck and recalling the cards in a chronological order.

It consists of the following components:
- A PAO (Person-Action-Object) matrix.
- A quiz interface with randomized card decks.
- A memory palace interface.
