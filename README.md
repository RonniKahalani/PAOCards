This memory technique is used in the World Memory Championships, where you quickly browse through a random shuffled deck of cards and recall the cards in chronological order.

This web app is used to train this memory technique and expand your capacity to memorize a full deck of cards, chronologically.

## Why?
You might think, "Why would I want to spend my precious time on trying to memorize a random deck of playing cards, chronologically?"

Because memorizing playing cards,

- is the best memory exercise ever.
- will improve your overall memory functions.
- makes you good at memorizing long lists, via memory palaces.
- develops killer abilities with memorizing and managing abstractions.
- improves your imagination.
- makes you more mentally agile.
- helps with language learning.
- improves your critical thinking.
- is a cool party stunt and a legitimate sport.
- is a transferable skill.
- will give you untold waves of accomplishment and self-esteem.
- makes you excel at card games like bridge, poker and blackjack.
- But most importantly, mastering this memory skill, makes you the champion of your own mind, because you managed to force your brain to learn something new and complex, which will benefit you in the future.

I would guess that you can master this technique, in about a few weeks, if you put some effort into it. Trust yourself, you can do it and you'll get a major kick and self-esteem out of it.

## Components
It consists of the following components:
- PAO (Person-Action-Object) Matrix.
- Quiz interface with randomized card decks.
- Memory Palace interface.

## PAO Matrix
<p>If you're "normal", you can master this skill in a few weeks, but you have to be disciplined, persistent and focus on memorizing the PAO Matrix.</p>

## PAO Quiz
<p>The Quiz interface helps you train your PAO Matrix memory speed and correctness, by prompting you to recall the Person, Action & Object values for a given card.</p>
<img width="100%" src="https://learningisliving.dk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/paocards-quiz.png" alt="Quiz">
<p>So the correct answers are</p>

- Person = Victoria Beckham
- Action = Applies makeup in front of
- Object = Mirror
- Card = Queen of Clubs (Q&clubs;)

## PAO Memory Palace
<p>The Memory Palace interface helps you train and navigate your memory palace, which holds 52 cards, in 17 locations, each holding the next 3 cards, with one last card left.</p>
<img width="100%" src="https://learningisliving.dk/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/paocards-palace.png" alt="Quiz">

Each location defines a weird memorable sentence, from its three cards, that you should take a second and visualize in your mind, by combining:<br>
- the person value of the first card = Victoria Beckham<br>
- the action value of the second card = Breaks nail on<br>
- the object value of the third card = Cigarette<br>

<p>So the sentence = "Victoria Beckham - Breaks nail on - Cigarette" represents Q&clubs; - 2&hearts; - 3&diams;</p>
